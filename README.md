VEKTAR QUAKE
============
Multiplayer Modification
			
Mod Description
===============

Vektar Quake is a mod that is designed to be played with more than
2 players. You can play on all the Multiplayer Deathmatch maps
of Quake (dm1-dm6).
You start of with the default Quake loadout, can also pickup
weapons and ammunition but armor is not existent, your goal
is to find and destroy a statue called the Vektar. Once destroyed 
it will drop a unique item - the Vektar-Quad - which you have to pick up
to get points. But beware, I suggest you do not stand too
close to the Vektar when attempting to break it open - it perhaps
will take you down aswell.
			  
================================================================

Installation
============

Go into your Quake directory and create a new folder named "vektar". 
Unzip all the files of this zip into that folder.
Now load Quake with the commandline parameter: -game vektar
You should see a statue standing in the mainmenu background,
that means the mod was loaded correctly. Now proceed and launch
a normal multiplayer game as usual, but using only the Quake
Deathmatch maps.
